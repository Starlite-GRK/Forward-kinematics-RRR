# Forward-kinematics-RRR

**Objective:**
The objective of this project was to create a workspace animation of a RRR robot using forward kinematics specifically geometric approach as well as find the final transformation matrix using user entered parameters using the DH approach.

**Introduction:**
A robot is a mechanical device (software controlled) that uses sensors to guide/control one or more end effectors though programmed motions in a workspace in order to manipulate physical objects.
Manipulators are the kind of robots which have a fixed base and manipulate their environment. In simple words they can be undertood as a robot with a fixed base that can move the objects around it such as the industrial arms.
This project has a RRR manipulator i.e. it has three recolute joints and 3 degrees of freedom.
In robot kinematics, forward kinematics refers to the computation of the pose (position and orientation) of the end-effector using the joint parameters (in this case the three joint angles) by the application of kinematic equations.

**MATLAB Add-Ons used:**
Robotics System Toolbox
